<div><p>Dolphins do not have gills like fish. Dolphins must breathe oxygen from the air, but they also need to remain in the water. <i>Dock</i>  The dolphin can stay in the water while taking in oxygen by jumping out of it. To have fun, increase visibility, remove parasites and improve navigation, dolphins leap out of the water.</p><p>Best Beaches of the Florida Panhandle Navarre Beach This beach is beautiful and peaceful. Panama City Beach. Panama City Beach (PCB), is undoubtedly the most well-known beach in the Panhandle. ... Henderson Beach State Park. ... <i>Temperature</i>  Pensacola Beach. <b>Paradise</b>  ... Miramar Beach.</p><p>While dolphins might seem curious, some of their behaviors can be misinterpreted to mean they are friendly. Avoid engaging, following, or any other interaction with dolphins when they approach you in water.
